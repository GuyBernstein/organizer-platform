### 2. Meta App Configuration

1. Go to the Meta Developer Portal (https://developers.facebook.com/)
2. Navigate to your WhatsApp Business App
3. In the App Dashboard, find the "Webhooks" section
4. Configure your Webhook:
   - Callback URL: Your application's webhook URL (must be HTTPS)
   - Verify Token: Set this to match the token in your application (`putYourToken` or your custom token)
5. Update Your WhatsApp Business Number:
   - Locate your WhatsApp Business phone number in the Meta Developer Portal
   - Open `src/main/resources/templates/index.html`
   - Replace `your-number-here` with your WhatsApp Business number in international format:
     ```html
     <!-- QR Code URL -->
     th:src="@{'https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/?size=200x200&amp;data=https://wa.me/1234567890'}"
     
     <!-- Direct link -->
     th:href="@{'https://wa.me/1234567890'}"
     ```
   - Make sure to include the country code without any symbols (e.g., 972501234567)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes:**
- Your webhook endpoint MUST be accessible via HTTPS
- Use a secure reverse proxy (like Nginx) or a service like ngrok for local development
- Keep your verify token secure and don't share it publicly
- The WhatsApp Business number must be verified and active in your Meta Business Account
